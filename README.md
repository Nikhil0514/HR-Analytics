# HR-Analytics
Designed a Power BI dashboard to track employee data for the HR team, including working hours, attendance, performance, and leaves. The dashboard streamlined HR processes and increased efficiency.
## Project Overview
### Understanding the HR Requirements
The excel data provided by our client Pinali shows the employee data who are working in ATliq Hardware company for the three months i,e Apr- June for the fiscal year 2022. She wants to analyze attendance data for work from home and work from office to understand preferences and percentages of people present.
## Dat

## What do we need to find out?
1. Working Preference of people(WFH/WFO)
2. If they are taking frequent WFH on Mondays and Fridays, If yes, what could be the reason?
3. Understand the pattern of their attendance.
4. Understand the percentage of employees who are taking WFH.
5. If the company is providing a hybrid model, like 2 days WFO and 3 days WFH, then on which day can we plan any such group 
   activity so that majority of people are present?
6. Implement hybrid work model to save cost on infrastructure
7. Identify employee sick leave patterns to improve sanitization measures
8. Analyzing data for fall activity planning.
## Gathering and Transforming Data
The HR department gathered the data over three months.
1. We did merge the data from all three months.
2. We created a template in Power Bi so that we could replicate the further steps.
3. We created required measures in Power Bi such as Total No. Of Working Days,WFH Count, Present Days etc.
4. It is usually a good practice to group the measures in one place.
5. Understanding the calculate function in DAX is very important.
6. We can also add additional columns to our data using Dax.
## Insights
1. The WFH% graph clearly shows a tendency towards increased WFH preference on Thursdays and Fridays (around 15%).
2. The highest attendance rates are on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays (about 85%).
3. If the organisation offers a hybrid work model, we can schedule any events so that we can maximise participation during 
   the first three days of the week.
4. The sick leave trend line is slightly rising, and on Mondays, we have the highest sick leave percentage. After analysing 
   the data for three months, we can see that the highest percentage, or 2.55%, occurred in the month of June.
5. Since more employees are ready to WFH on Thursdays and Fridays, we may schedule any maintenance activities around those 
   days.
